<p>What is tape?</p>

<p>Tape is a narrow strip of material, as used to hold or fasten something. 
Tapes are mainly used for bonding or joining objects together instead of using fasteners, screws, or welding. 
Tapes consist of a material called a backing or carrier (paper, plastic film, cloth, foam, foil, etc.), which is coated with an adhesive and a release liner if needed. 
Adhesive means being able to stick fast to a surface or object, sticky. The adhesive-coated backing or carrier is then wound up to form a long jumbo roll of tape. 
Pressing the tape on a surface causes these large polymers to spread out. The spread-out adhesive now interacts and bonds with the surface, causing the tape to stick. 
The most common types of tape are masking tape, tape that acts as replaced paint on walls. flooring tape, tape that is used to fix floors. Duct tape, normal tape, just stronger. 
electrical tape is used to fix wires. packing tape, tape used for closing packed boxes. 
painter's tape, tapes used for art, and double-sided or mounting tape, tape that has adhesive on both sides. 
Other types of tape have specialized applications, such as surgical tape, and tapes used on people, to attach bandages. hazard tape, tapes used to keep people away from places, and gaffer tape, duct tape but stronger. 
The history of adhesive tape occurred during its first appearance in 1845. Dr. Horace Day, a surgeon used a rubber adhesive applied to strips of fabrics to make an invention called Surgical Tape. 
It was then made of different materials and used for other purposes. 
The disadvantages of tapes are that they Can be bulky (particularly if using a bracing option), It Can be harmful if not performed correctly (e.g., further injury, skin damage, etc.), they Can restrict movement and therefore performance, they Could increase risk of injury to other joints and differing on tapes some can be expensive. 
However, the tape can Provide structural strength that can replace bolts, rivets, welds, and other mechanical fasteners. 
It Can use lighter thinner materials. 
It can also Bond dissimilar materials without incompatibility concerns and can Act as a moisture seal/environmental barrier.</p>
