<p>What is a Light Bulb?</p>
<IMG SRC="text project images/light bulb.gif"/>
<p>Light bulbs are used to shine in a dark room. 
It is to make the room shine brighter so it is possible to see better at night, literally an artificial dim sun. 
Light bulbs consist of an air-tight glass enclosure in the envelope, or bulb with a filament of tungsten wire inside the bulb, through which an electric current is passed. 
It connects wires and a base with two or more conductors to provide electrical connections to the filament, it then glows using pure electricity on a round metal line in the bulb. 
To make the shell, the raw materials for glass, soda ash, and limestone are mixed and heated. 
The molten glass is carried along a conveyor belt and air nozzles blow the glass through holes in the belt into moulds creating the shape of the shell. 
Such a machine can produce more than 50,000 bulbs each hour The cap or base of a light bulb joins the bulb to the lamp socket to provide an electrical connection. 
When the switch button used pushed, the light will start to shine. 
Incandescent light bulbs are any light bulb that is seen everywhere. 
Halogen bulbs, normal bulbs on steroids. 
Fluorescent lights, just a cooler-looking bulbs, and LED bulbs, are lights used in a party. 
Long before Thomas Edison patented first in 1879 and then a year later in 1880 and then began commercializing his incandescent light bulb, British inventors were demonstrating that electric light was possible with the arc lamp. 
Light bulbs are small artificial suns, so staring at them has a high chance of causing blindness.  
Financial costs, depending on what type of light you are buying, its size, and its quality, can be expensive. 
Environmentally, it is a wasteful amount of energy consumption. 
A typical 100-watt incandescent bulb uses 75% more energy than an equivalent CFL (compact fluorescent light Light). 
Quality options, there are way too many lights to choose from depending on their size. 
Fragility, light bulbs can be very fragile, fragile meaning it is easily damaged and weak. 
Heating danger could straight up burn your house down when more voltage is used in the light, The overheating can not only damage your bulb but can also damage every wire connected in your house. 
There are many benefits but mainly it can increase energy efficiency, lower electric bills, a longer bulb life, and a better and safer light source overall.</p>
