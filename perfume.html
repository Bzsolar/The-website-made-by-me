<p>It Is an item that can spray sweat smell using the liquid inside it. 
Perfumes are used to give a pleasant and desirable scent to a person's body. 
It is made by extracting oil from sweat-smelling ingredients, the smell differs from each ingredient. 
The average perfume smell found everywhere is benzyl alcohol, acetone, linalool, ethanol, ethyl acetate, benzaldehyde, camphor, formaldehyde, methylene chloride, and limonene. 
Oils are extracted from ingredients such as flowers or leaves, then heat is used to evaporate the alcohol, this leaves a higher concentration of perfume oil on the bottom of the liquid being heated. 
The bottom oil is then poured inside into a small glass bottle in different shapes. The bottles have six different names, falcon, perfume atomizer, perfume decanter, perfume vial, atomizer bottle, and spray bottle. 
The perfume oil in the bottle evaporates from the droplets within a few seconds, after pushing the top button, leaving behind a droplet of the fragrant compounds in the perfume. 
These compounds will also eventually evaporate to form a vapor of the fragrant molecules, therefore, spreading sweat-smelling particles around the air. 
The perfume was first formed over 4000 years ago by ancient Egyptians, it was incorporated into their culture, and it was then followed by the ancient Chinese, Hindus, Israelites, Carthaginians, Arabs, Greeks, and Romans. 
Perfumes are only meant to be sprayed occasionally. If the perfume is used consistently every day, it could cause sickness. On average About 1 in 3 people report having health problems when exposed to fragranced products. 
Those problems include asthma attacks, hay fever, headache, migraine, dizziness, breathing problems, rashes, congestion, nausea, and seizures. 
Perfumes can trigger your brain to boost your confidence, control your stress levels, and can reduce headaches.</p>
